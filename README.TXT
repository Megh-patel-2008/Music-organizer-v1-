Authors: David J. Barnes and Michael Kölling

This project is part of the material for the book

   Objects First with Java - A Practical Introduction using BlueJ
   Seventh edition
   David J. Barnes and Michael Kölling

It is discussed in chapter 4.

To start:

Create a MusicOrganizer object on the object bench.
Use its methods to add, show, and remove files.

Work done by : Megh Patel & Noel Joseph Jovero


1. The reason why it works in order is thanks to the array list
2. No it doesn't give an error the program does run but it have no effect
3. After doing the actions after deleting the file associated with the array 0,
   the second files which was assosiated with array 1 will be brought up in the front
   so it becomes array 0 
4. privat Arraylist<Back> library;
5. ArrayList <Student> cs101; 
6. private ArrayList <MusicTrack> tracks;
7. library = new Arraylist<>();
   cs101 = new Arraylist 
   tracks = new Arraylist<>();
8. The value would be return 10 
9. items.get(4);
10.Last stored item is 14
11.files.add(FavoriteTrack);
12.dates.remove(2);
13.It becomes index 5
14.public void checkIndex(int index)
    {
        //question 14
        if(index >= 0 && index < files.size()-1){
            System.out.print("The valid range is " + index);
        }
    }
15.public boolean validIndex(int index){
        //Question 15
        if(index >= 0 && index < files.size()-1){
        return true;
        }
        else{
            System.out.print("The valid range is " + index);
            return false;
        }
    }
